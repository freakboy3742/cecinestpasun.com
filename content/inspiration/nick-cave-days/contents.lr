text: All of our days are numbered. We cannot afford to be idle. To act on a bad idea is better than to not act at all. Because the worth of the idea never becomes apparent until you do it. Sometimes this idea can be the smallest thing in the world. A little flame that you hunch over and cup with your hand, and pray will not be extinguished by all the storm that howls about. If you can hold on to that flame, great things can be constructed around it, that are massive, and powerful, and world changing. All held up by the tiniest of ideas.
